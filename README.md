# gfx-hal tutorials

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mistodon/gfx-hal-tutorials.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mistodon/gfx-hal-tutorials)

These tutorials are currently undergoing a significant rewrite. You can see the old examples in the [pre-0.1.0 branch](https://github.com/mistodon/gfx-hal-tutorials/tree/pre-0.1.0). You can also see the writeups here:

- [Part 0: Drawing a triangle](https://falseidolfactory.com/2018/08/16/gfx-hal-part-0-drawing-a-triangle.html)
- [Part 1: Resizing windows](https://falseidolfactory.com/2018/08/23/gfx-hal-part-1-resizing-windows.html)
- [Part 2: Vertex buffers](https://falseidolfactory.com/2018/10/09/gfx-hal-part-2-vertex-buffers.html)

**But** please bear in mind, they are not likely to be very useful, given how much the API has changed since they were written. Please look forward to the rewritten versions coming soon!
