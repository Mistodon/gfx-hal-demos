General TODOs
===

1.  Cross-platform Cargo.toml
2.  Show simple Cargo.toml in adocs
3.  Add comments to each code snippet, but only show them in the document they appear first in (`ifeval::[{current_part} < ${part-this-snippet-appears-in}`)
4.  Fix all the expect/unwraps
5.  Search for last minute TODOs
6.  Start with the shaders in every part!
7.  Get the color space correct
